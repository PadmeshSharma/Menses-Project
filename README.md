# Menses-Project
Menstruation is still a taboo in society, primarily involves stigma around discussing and caring for menstrual needs. Only 57.6 per cent women in India use sanitary napkins and 23 million girls drop out of school annually after they start their periods. This website will help in generating awareness by tracking period dates, predicting potential dates, predicting potential ovulation date, identify gynecological issue if any, tips and articles about hygiene, sexual and reproduction issues and a way to connect to renowned sex educators anonymously.
